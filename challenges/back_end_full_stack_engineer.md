# Appear Here Backend/Full Stack Code Challenge

Thanks for agreeing to have a crack at our code challenge.

## The challenge

The goal for this current "sprint" is to write an application that will allow users to search Foursquare for coffee shops, based on full UK postcodes (e.g. EC1R 5DW).

Caffeine-seekers expect to be able to:

* view the results of their search in a list and/or on a map
* see the results sorted by popularity
* tell when there are - horror - no results so they can search somewhere else

You will need to generate Foursquare API keys for use from the [Foursquare Developer website](https://developer.foursquare.com/).

### What we look for

* We're strict on tests, testability, clean and readable code
* We care about whether or not the app meets the given requirements
* Imagine this is one part of a large app and you are on a team. A
  one-line codegolf Rack app is neat and cool, but won't give us an
  insight into how you'd work on our real codebase.
* Think about performance, edge-cases and error handling, SOLID principles
* Think about usability and the experience of using the app

### What tools to use

Feel free to use any tools, libraries & gems you like, the only limitation is that you code your solution in Ruby; we're polyglots too, but we have to maintain our core.

### How to deliver your code/app

Once you're finished, deploy your solution. Email us back a link to the deployed application and attach your code as a git bundle ([documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle)).

*Please don't push to a public repo e.g. on Github.*

### How long to spend

We're looking for an app and code that you're proud of.

It shouldn't take more than a few hours, but there's no set time limit. Within a week is good.

Ultimately we're going to make a judgement about your skill level and approach on this basis, so if you're not happy with it, don't send it!

### What happens next?

We'll take a look at your code and get back to you with feedback within 7 days.

That's it! Good luck.
