# Appear Here Product Designer Challenge

This exercise is to design the listing page for an events website. Events listed on the app are geared towards founders of small to medium businesses and are usually part of a specific category e.g. finance, marketing, and technology.

You should design the listing page, surfacing the information you think is most important in order to help the user select and sign up for a particular event.

This is a green field project, so there are no prescribed features (aside from a list of events) or aesthetic. You should choose these appropriately for the audience.

While you’ll only be designing one page, please consider how it works in the grand scheme of things, i.e. the information architecture, navigation, and cross device support.

We’re not looking for the best possible solution; instead we’re looking for an insight into your process. We’d love to see every stage (sketches, brainstorms, wireframes etc. are all great), all the way up to a design in the fidelity you deem appropriate for this type of project. Bonus points if you include some form of interactive prototype.

It shouldn't take more than 10 hours, but there's no set time limit. Within a week is good. Don’t spend too long on the task; it doesn’t need to be complete. Ultimately we're going to make a judgement about your skill level and approach on this basis.
