# Appear Here Designer Challenge

Congratulations on making it through the first interview. Next we would like to give you the opportunity to show off your product thinking.

As a part of the design and product team, one of your challenges will be to showcase our spaces to brands. So, for this challenge we would like you to conceptualise and prototype a space listing page for Appear Here.

You should surface the information you think is most important to help the user decide if this is the space for their idea. Other than booking the space, there are no prescribed features. 

We want to see how you understand and represent our brand (this will help https://bloom.appearhere.co.uk) and while you’ll only be designing one page, please consider how it works in the grand scheme of things, i.e., the information architecture, navigation, and cross device support.

We’re not looking for the best possible solution; instead we’re looking for an insight into your process. We’d love to see every stage (sketches, brainstorms, wireframes etc. are all great), all the way up to a design in the fidelity you deem appropriate for this type of project. Bonus points if you include some form of interactive prototype.

There's no set time limit as we care more about the design output than how short or long it took to create. Getting it back to us in a week is good.

We'll take a look at your designs and get back to you with feedback within a few days. That's it! 

Good luck.
