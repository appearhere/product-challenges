# Appear Here Visual Designer Challenge

Imagine that you are a product designer at Airbnb. The product team is tasked to conceptualise and prototype a new section of the platform that’s focused on Events.

You should design the events listing page, surfacing the information you think is most important in order to help the user select and sign up for a particular event.

This is a green field project, so there are no prescribed features (aside from a list of events) or aesthetic. You should choose these appropriately for the audience.

While you’ll only be designing one page, please consider how it works in the grand scheme of things, i.e., the information architecture, navigation, and cross device support.

We’re not looking for the best possible solution; instead we’re looking for an insight into your process. We’d love to see every stage (sketches, brainstorms, wireframes etc. are all great), all the way up to a design in the fidelity you deem appropriate for this type of project. Bonus points if you include some form of interactive prototype.

There's no set time limit as we care more about the design output than how short or long it took to create. Getting it back to us in a week is good.

We'll take a look at your designs and get back to you with feedback within a few days. That's it! Good luck.
